## Makefile usage
- Create a new directory on the terminal
- Add the `Makefile` to any new python project
- Ensure python `virtualenv` is installed on the host machine by running `make install`
- Activate the virtual environment by running `make start`
- Execute your development tasks and proceed with normal workflow
- Deactivate the virtual environment by running `make stop`
- Update project requirements by running `make list`
- Remove python residual artifacts by running `make clean`
- Terminate and destroy a virtual environment by running `make delete`

```
